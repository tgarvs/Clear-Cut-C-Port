#  Clear Cut



## Lessons Learned
- Give each entity it's own hit box, which is used for collision detection and seperate from the sprite
- Make sure sprite art sheets are formatted correctly and normally
- There's gotta be a better way to select the start/game/gameover screens without shoving all the main game movements into one huge function
